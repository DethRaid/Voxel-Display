RIT/SSE - Voxel Display Project
---

Society of Software Engineers' project to build a 3D display using voxels in a real 3D space.

Hi there? Are you here to try out our 3D Browser-based voxel simulator? [You can find it here.](http://rit-sse.github.io/Voxel-Display/)

The browser simulator is pretty cool - you can use your mouse and arrow keys to navigate around the 3d view. 

At first, the display is simply off. You can begin toggling voxels as you please by using the controls in the upper left.

You'll notice the "browse" button - this file selector lets you run an application with the display. Example applications can be found [in the apps folder.](https://github.com/rit-sse/Voxel-Display/tree/gh-pages/apps)
