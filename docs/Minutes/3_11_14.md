- We now have specs on the Smart Film
  - They were posted on the email, and listed on the [github-issues](https://github.com/rit-sse/Voxel-Display/issues/8)

  - Listed low transmittance, which may be a concern
    - [Work is being done to determine how much of an issue this may be.](https://github.com/rit-sse/Voxel-Display/issues/19)

- We have a place for keeping the film, one of the Imaging Science Lab!
  - If you need access to the film, ask Jesse Jurman, Michael Timbrook, or Cicely DiPaulo

- We have a working piece of Smart-Film!
  - It's currently in the Imaging Science Lab
  - The battery is rented from K2GXT - The RIT Amateur Radio Club
    - [One of the tasks is to purchase a new power supply unit.](https://github.com/rit-sse/Voxel-Display/issues/18)

- We talked with Jason Faulring about the Patent Process
  - He recommended Bill Bonds at the Innovation Center

    - If they are not, the expenses are out of our price range

###Current Tasks
_All Tasks are listed on the Github Issues for the Voxel Display repo_
- [Decide / Buy Micro-Controller](https://github.com/rit-sse/Voxel-Display/issues/15)
  - Texas Instruments sells a micro-controller with a built in USB controller, and lots of fun features!
    - They offer a free sample (which is the entire board), and a cheap dev board (~$20)
    - Link Here: http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-msp430-msp-exp430f5529lp.html#tabs

###Discussion Point
- Spring Break
  - If people are going to be in Rochester, and want to work on the voxel display, email jrj2703@rit.edu
  - We can always dedicate the time to building the applications
  
###Advisor
- Jesse is more than willing to enlist the help of a professor and discuss with them the ongoing progress of the project.
  - A professor (SE or otherwise) has yet to be decided.
